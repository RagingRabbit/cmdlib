# cmdlib
A single-file header only library for displaying formatted text in the console window.

This library is still very early in development and might contain bugs as well as missing features.
It has only been tested on Windows 10 so far, a linux port might be possible in the future.

Note that it requires a terminal that supports VT sequences in order to work.
On Windows, this support was added in the Windows 10 anniversary update.
Using a Windows version prior to that will most likely either not work at all or cause unexpected behaviour.
